# sqlalchemy-challenge
Finally! Ive decided to treat myself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. I decide to do a climate analysis about the area


Before I Begin:
1. Create a new repo for the project and then clone it to the computer
2. Create a Jupyter notebook which will be used to analyze data
3. Download the necessary files, which includes but is not limited to, The Starter Code and Resource files.


Now the fun Begins!

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Use Python and SQLAlchemy to do climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. Use SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

Part 2: Design Your Climate App
Design a Flask API based on the queries just developed
